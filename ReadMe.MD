## Description:

_The purpose of this test suite is to demonstrate using TestCafe to create functional web tests on the website AutomationPractice.com_

## Tests:

In creating this framework using TestCafe, I have written simple test cases for the following test types:

1. Smoke Test
2. Sanity Test
3. End-to-end Regression Test

## Running this test in your local:
